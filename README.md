drone
=====

DIY Arduino DUE (ARM 32bit) quad copter drone with node.js telemetry
Aimed to be flexible enough that anyone can jump in and use their own hardware.

WARNING
=======

Flying robots are dangerous, and can be unpredictable, cut eyes and limbs. Test without blades on your motors, and secure your drone down while testing. Good luck!

Status
=======

2  November  2013 - Receiver support added and motor output simplified.
18 October   2013 - Sampling rate up to 1160hz! Reduced noise and responsiveness.
09 October   2013 - Vector gyro/compass/accelerometer reference system completed
27 September 2013 - Started

Documentation
=============

Set your arduino ide to the main folder so it finds the `/libraries` folder, alternatively copy them over to your libraries folder. Expand them to support your hardware.

Load up `/drone/drone.ino` in Arduino IDE and have fun.

See `/drone/UserConfiguration.h` for quick settings. 

See `/libraries` for motor and receiver PINs.

Channel 5 on the receiver arms the PID system. You can see LED on pin 13 will be ON when it's armed.

More detailed documentation to follow. 

A lot of source is from `https://github.com/AeroQuad/AeroQuad`

Telemetry
===========

Open up command prompt.

`cd drone\droneConnect`

You probably have to edit the droneConnect.js file and specify the correct COM port. Then run:

`node droneConnect.js`

Open up [localhost/graph.htm](http://localhost/) and enjoy.
